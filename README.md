# Darknot XFCE4 Notification Theme

![Darknot Notification Preview](https://github.com/ozd64/darknot-xfce-notification-theme/blob/main/darknot-preview.png?raw=true)

##### Simple, elegant dark notification design targeting XFCE4 platforms.

## Installation
Installing the Darknot theme is fairly simple. Copying the `darknot` folder into your `/usr/share/themes` folder should enable the theme for your XFCE system. (Please note that you will be asked to provide sudo permissions) Besides, copying the `darknot` folder into your `~/.local/share/themes` should also work.

***Arch Linux AUR package will be provided in the future***

## Contributing and Reporting
Contributions are always welcome! I'm personally not good at CSS though. That is, I might have made some mistakes with making the notification theme. Please feel free to approach in the case of theme issues.
